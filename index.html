        <section id="his"><b>History</b><br>
            Archaeological and other evidence shows swimming to have been practiced as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt and thereafter in Assyrian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. In Greece and Rome swimming was a part of martial training and was, with the alphabet, also part of elementary education for males.The first swimming championship was a 440-yard (400-meter) race, held in Australia in 1846 and annually thereafter. The Metropolitan Swimming Clubs of London, founded in 1869, ultimately became the Amateur Swimming Association, the governing body of British amateur swimming. National swimming federations were formed in several European countries from 1882 to 1889. In the United States swimming was first nationally organized as a sport by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on its founding in 1888. The Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA; from 2023 called World Aquatics) was founded in 1909.<br></section>

        <b>The women's 100-meter freestyle at the Los Angeles Olympics produced two gold medals.<br>

        Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer were roommates on the U.S. team, and as if to prove how close they were, the two friends were together in front of the pack in the final.<br>
        
        The two touched the wall at exactly the same time—55.92 seconds—producing the first official tie in Olympic swimming history.<br>
        
        Hogshead would swim legs on the gold-medal winning 400 freestyle and 400 medley relays as well as earn a silver in the 200 medley. Steinseifer, who was just 16 at the time, also swam a leg on the 400 freestyle relay.
        <br>
        At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Americans Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin tied for first in the 50 freestyle.</b></section></div>
